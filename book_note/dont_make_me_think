krug’s first law of usability

And as a rule, people don’t like to puzzle over how to do things. The fact that
the people who built the site didn’t care enough to make things obvious—and
easy—can erode our confidence in the site and its publishers.

Break pages up into clearly defined areas
Make it obvious what’s clickable
Minimize noise.

The more important something is, the more
prominent it is.
Things that are related logically are also related
visually.
Things are “nested” visually to show what’s part of what.

There are two important things to know about Web conventions:
Designers are often reluctant to take advantage of them.
They’re very useful.

Busy-ness
Background noise.
