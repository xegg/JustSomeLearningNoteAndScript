Don’t make me think!
krug’s first law of usability

And as a rule, people don’t like to puzzle over how to do things. The fact that
the people who built the site didn’t care enough to make things obvious—and
easy—can erode our confidence in the site and its publishers.

On the Internet, the competition
is always just one click away,
so if you frustrate users they’ll
head somewhere else.

## Cht 2:
How we really use the Web
scanning, satisficing, and muddling through

What we see when we look at a Web page depends on what we have in mind, but
it’s usually just a fraction of what’s on the page.

FACT OF LIFE # 2 :
We don’t make optimal choices. We satisfice.

If life gives you lemons...
By now you may be thinking (given this less than rosy picture of the Web
audience and how they use the Web), “Why don’t I just get a job at the local 7-11?
At least there my efforts might be appreciated.”
So, what’s a girl to do?
I think the answer is simple: If your audience is going to act like you’re designing
billboards, then design great billboards.

chapter 3
Billboard Design 101
designing pages for scanning, not reading

Create a clear visual hierarchy on each page
Take advantage of conventions
Break pages up into clearly defined areas
Make it obvious what’s clickable
Minimize noise.

The more important something is, the more
prominent it is.
Things that are related logically are also related
visually.
Things are “nested” visually to show what’s part of what.

There are two important things to know about Web conventions:
Designers are often reluctant to take advantage of them.
They’re very useful.

Busy-ness
Background noise.

chapter 4
It doesn’t matter how many times I have to click, as long as
each click is a mindless, unambiguous choice.
“three mindless, unambiguous clicks
equal one click that requires thought.” 2

The point is, we face choices all the time on the Web and making the choices
mindless is one of the main things that make a site easy to use.

chapter 5
Omit needless
words
the art of not writing for the web

Get rid of half the words on each page,
then get rid of half of what’s left.
—krug’s third law of usability

17. Omit needless words.
Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no
unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences,
for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnec-
essary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. 1


Happy talk must die
We all know happy talk when we see it: It’s the introductory text that’s supposed
to welcome us to the site and tell us how great it is, or to tell us what we’re about
to see in the section we’ve just entered.

Instructions must die
The other major source of needless words is instructions. The main thing you
need to know about instructions is that no one is going to read them—at least not
until after repeated attempts at “muddling through” have failed. And even then, if
the instructions are wordy, the odds of users finding the information they need is
pretty low.
