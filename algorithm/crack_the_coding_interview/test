12.2	 You are given the source to an application which crashes when it is run. After running
it ten times in a debugger, you find it never crashes in the same place. The application
is single threaded, and uses only the C standard library. What programming errors
could be causing this crash? How would you test each one?
	
SOLUTION
The question largely depends on the type of application being diagnosed. However, we can
give some general causes of random crashes.
1.	 Random variable: The application uses some random number or variable component
which may not be fixed for every execution of the program. Examples include: user
input, a random number generated by the program, or the time of day.
2.	 Memory Leak: The program may have run out of memory. Other culprits are totally
random for each run since it depends on the number of processes running at that
particular time. This also includes heap overflow or corruption of data on the stack.
It is also possible that the program depends on another application / external module that
could lead to the crash. If our application, for example, depends on some system attributes
and they are modified by another program, then this interference may lead to a crash. Pro-
grams which interact with hardware are more prone to these errors.
In an interview, we should ask about which kind of application is being run. This information
may give you some idea about the kind of error the interviewer is looking for. For example,
a web server is more prone to memory leakage, whereas a program that runs close to the
system level is more prone to crashes due to system dependencies.


12.3	 We have the following method used in a chess game: boolean canMoveTo(int x, int y)
x and y are the coordinates of the chess board and it returns whether or not the piece
can move to that position. Explain how you would test this method.
	
pg 70
SOLUTION
There are two primary types of testing we should do:
Validation of input/output:
We should validate both the input and output to make sure that each are valid. This might
entail:
1.	
Checking whether input is within the board limit.
» » Attempt to pass in negative numbers
» » Attempt to pass in x which is larger than the width
» » Attempt to pass in y which is larger than the width
Depending on the implementation, these should either return false or throw an excep-
tion.
2.	
Checking if output is within the valid set of return values. (Not an issue in this case,
since there are no “invalid” boolean values.)
Functional testing:
Ideally, we would like to test every possible board, but this is far too big. We can do a reason-
able coverage of boards however. There are 6 pieces in chess, so we need to do something
like this:
1	
2	
3	
4	
5	
6	
foreach piece a:
	
for each other type of piece b (6 types + empty space)
		
foreach direction d
			
Create a board with piece a.
			
Place piece b in direction d.
			
Try to move – check return value.


12.5	 How would you test a pen?
SOLUTION
This problem is largely about understand the constraints: what exactly is the pen? You
should ask a lot of questions to understand what exactly you are trying to test. To illustrate
the technique in this problem, let us guide you through a mock-conversation.
Interviewer: How would you test a pen?
Candidate: Let me find out a bit about the pen. Who is going to use the pen?
Interviewer: Probably children.
Candidate: Ok, that’s interesting. What will they be doing with it? Will they be writing, draw-
ing, or doing something else with it?
Interviewer: Drawing.
Candidate: Ok, great. On what? Paper? Clothing? Walls?
Interviewer: On clothing.
Candidate: Great. What kind of tip does the pen have? Felt? Ball point? Is it intended to
wash off, or is it intended to be permanent?
Interviewer: It’s intended to wash off.
.... many questions later ...
Candidate: Ok, so as I understand it, we have a pen that is being targeted at 5—10 year olds.
The pen has a felt tip and comes in red, green, blue and black. It’s intended to wash off cloth-
ing. Is that correct?
...
The candidate now has a problem that is significantly different from what it initially seemed
to be. Thus, the candidate might now want to test:
1.	 Does the pen wash off with warm water, cold water, and luke warm water?
2.	 Does the pen wash off after staying on the clothing for several weeks? What happens if
you wash the clothing while the pen is still wet?
3.	 Is the pen safe (e.g.—non-toxic) for children?
and so on...
