13.1	 Write a method to print the last K lines of an input file using C++.
			
pg 76
SOLUTION
One brute force way could be to count the number of lines (N) and then print from N-10 to
Nth line. But, this requires two reads of the file – potentially very costly if the file is large.
We need a solution which allows us to read just once and be able to print the last K lines. We
can create extra space for K lines and then store each set of K lines in the array. So, initially,
our array has lines 0 through 9, then 1 through 10, then 2 through 11, etc (if K = 10). Each
time that we read a new line, we purge the oldest line from the array. Instead of shifting the
array each time (very inefficient), we will use a circular array. This will allow us to always find
the oldest element in O(1) time.

string L[K];
int lines = 0;
while (file.good()) {
	
getline(file, L[lines % K]); // read file line by line
	
++lines;
}
// if less than K lines were read, print them all
int start, count;
if (lines < K) {
	
start = 0;
	
count = lines;
} else {
	
start = lines % K;
	
count = K;
}
for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i) {
	
cout << L[(start + i) % K] << endl;
}
OBSERVATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS:
» »
Note, if you do printf(L[(index + i) % K]) when there are %’s in the string, bad things will
happen.


13.2	 Compare and contrast a hash table vs. an STL map. How is a hash table implemented?
If the number of inputs is small, what data structure options can be used instead of
a hash table?
	
pg 76
SOLUTION
Compare and contrast Hash Table vs. STL map
In a hash table, a value is stored by applying hash function on a key. Thus, values are not
stored in a hash table in sorted order. Additionally, since hash tables use the key to find the
index that will store the value, an insert/lookup can be done in amortised O(1) time (assum-
ing only a few collisions in the hashtable). One must also handle potential collisions in a
hashtable.
In an STL map, insertion of key/value pair is in sorted order of key. It uses a tree to store
values, which is why an O(log N) insert/lookup is required. There is also no need to handle
collisions. An STL map works well for things like:
» » find min element
» » find max element
» » print elements in sorted order
» » find the exact element or, if the element is not found, find the next smallest number
How is a hash table implemented?
1.	 A good hash function is required (e.g.: operation % prime number) to ensure that the
hash values are uniformly distributed.
2.	 A collision resolving method is also needed: chaining (good for dense table entries),
probing (good for sparse table entries), etc.
3.	 Implement methods to dynamically increase or decrease the hash table size on a given
criterion. For example, when the [number of elements] by [table size] ratio is greater
than the fixed threshold, increase the hash table size by creating a new hash table and
transfer the entries from the old table to the new table by computing the index using
new hash function.
What can be used instead of a hash table, if the number of inputs is small?
You can use an STL map. Although this takes O(log n) time, since the number of inputs is
small, this time is negligible.

13.4	 What is the difference between deep copy and shallow copy? Explain how you would
use each.
	
pg 76
SOLUTION
struct Test {
	
char * ptr;
};
void shallow_copy(Test & src, Test & dest) {
	
dest.ptr = src.ptr;
}
void deep_copy(Test & src, Test & dest) {
	
dest.ptr = malloc(strlen(src.ptr) + 1);
	
memcpy(dest.ptr, src.ptr);
}
Note that shallow_copy may cause a lot of programming run-time errors, especially with the
creation and deletion of objects. Shallow copy should be used very carefully and only when
a programmer really understands what he wants to do. In most cases shallow copy is used
when there is a need to pass information about a complex structure without actual duplica-
tion of data (e.g., call by reference). One must also be careful with destruction of shallow
copy.
In real life, shallow copy is rarely used. There is an important programming concept called
“smart pointer” that, in some sense, is an enhancement of the shallow copy concept.
Deep copy should be used in most cases, especially when the size of the copied structure is
small.



13.5	 What is the significance of the keyword “volatile” in C?
		
pg 76
SOLUTION
Volatile informs the compiler that the value of the variable can change from the outside,
without any update done by the code.
Declaring a simple volatile variable:
volatile int x;
int volatile x;
Declaring a pointer variable for a volatile memory (only the pointer address is volatile):
volatile int * x;
int volatile * x;
Declaring a volatile pointer variable for a non-volatile memory (only memory contained is
volatile):
int * volatile x;
Declaring a volatile variable pointer for a volatile memory (both pointer address and memo-
ry contained are volatile):
volatile int * volatile x;
int volatile * volatile x;
Volatile variables are not optimized, but this can actually be useful. Imagine this function:
1	
2	
3	
4	
5	
6	
int opt = 1;
void Fn(void) {
	
start:
		
if (opt == 1) goto start;
		
else break;
}
At first glance, our code appears to loop infinitely. The compiler will try to optimize it to:
1	
2	
3	
4	
5	
6	
void Fn(void) {
	
start:
		
int opt = 1;
		
if (true)
		
goto start;
}
This becomes an infinite loop. However, an external program might write ‘0’ to the location
of variable opt. Volatile variables are also useful when multi-threaded programs have global
variables and any thread can modify these shared variables. Of course, we don’t want opti-
mization on them.


13.6	 What is name hiding in C++?	
		
pg 76
SOLUTION
Let us explain through an example. In C++, when you have a class with an overloaded meth-
od, and you then extend and override that method, you must override all of the overloaded
methods.
For example:
class FirstClass {
public:
	virtual void MethodA (int);
	virtual void MethodA (int, int);
};
void FirstClass::MethodA (int i) {
	std::cout << “ONE!!\n”;
}
void FirstClass::MethodA (int i, int j) {
	std::cout << “TWO!!\n”;
}
This is a simple class with two methods (or one overloaded method). If you want to override
the one-parameter version, you can do the following:
class SecondClass : public FirstClass {
public: 
void MethodA (int);
};
void SecondClass::MethodA (int i) {
	std::cout << “THREE!!\n”;
} void main () {
	SecondClass a;
	a.MethodA (1);
	a.MethodA (1, 1);
}
However, the second call won’t work, since the two-parameter MethodA is not visible. That
is name hiding.
