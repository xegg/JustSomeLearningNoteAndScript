5.1	
You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j. Write a
method to set all bits between i and j in N equal to M (e.g., M becomes a substring of
N located at i and starting at j).
EXAMPLE:
Input: N = 10000000000, M = 10101, i = 2, j = 6
Output: N = 10001010100
			
pg 58
SOLUTION
This code operates by clearing all bits in N between position i and j, and then ORing to put
M in there.

public static int updateBits(int n, int m, int i, int j) {
	int max = ~0; /* All 1’s */
	
// 1’s through position j, then 0’s
	int left = max - ((1 << j) - 1);
	// 1’s after position i
	 int right = ((1 << i) - 1);
	// 1’s, with 0s between i and j
    int mask = left | right;
	} // Clear i through j, then put m in there
    return (n & mask);
}
