SOLUTION
Let’s try to solve this by “re-wording” the problem. We will re-word the problem until we get
something that has removed all if statements.
Rewording 1: If a > b, return a; else, return b.
Rewording 2: If (a - b) is negative, return b; else, return a.
Rewording 3: If (a - b) is negative, let k = 1; else, let k = 0. Return a - k * (a - b).
Rewording 4: Let c = a - b. Let k = the most significant bit of c. Return a - k * c.
We have now reworded the problem into something that fits the requirements. The code
for this is below.
