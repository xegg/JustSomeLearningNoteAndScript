10.3	 Given two lines on a Cartesian plane, determine whether the two lines would inter-
sect.
	
pg 68
SOLUTION
There are a lot of unknowns in this problem (what format are the lines in? What if they are the
same line?), but let’s assume:
» » If two lines are the same (same line = same slope and y-intercept), they are considered
to intersect.
» » We get to decide the data structure.
public class Line {
	static double epsilon = 0.000001;
	public double slope;
	public double yintercept;
	
public Line(double s, double y) { 
slope = s; 
yintercept = y; 
} 
public boolean intersect(Line line2) { 
return Math.abs(slope - line2.slope) > epsilon || 
Math.abs(yintercept - line2.yintercept) < epsilon; 
} }
OBSERVATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS:
» » Ask questions. This question has a lot of unknowns—ask questions to clarify them. Many
interviewers intentionally ask vague questions to see if you’ll clarify your assumptions.
» » When possible, design and use data structures. It shows that you understand and care
about object oriented design.
» » Think through which data structures you design to represent a line. There are a lot of
options, with lots of trade offs. Pick one and explain your choice.
» » Don’t assume that the slope and y-intercept are integers.
» » Understand limitations of floating point representations. Never check for equality with
==.
