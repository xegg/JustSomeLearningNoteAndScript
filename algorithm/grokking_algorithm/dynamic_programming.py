• Every dynamic-programming solution involves a grid.
• The values in the cells are usually what you’re trying to optimize.
For the knapsack problem, the values were the value of the goods.
• Each cell is a subproblem, so think about how you can divide
your problem into subproblems. That will help you figure out what
the axes are.
