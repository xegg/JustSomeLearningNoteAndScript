I hope this gives you an idea of all the different things you can do with
KNN and with machine learning! Machine learning is an interesting
field that you can go pretty deep into if you decide to:
• KNN is used for classification and regression and involves looking
at the k-nearest neighbors.
• Classification = categorization into a group.
• Regression = predicting a response (like a number).
• Feature extraction means converting an item (like a fruit or a user)
into a list of numbers that can be compared.
• Picking good features is an important part of a successful KNN
algorithm.
