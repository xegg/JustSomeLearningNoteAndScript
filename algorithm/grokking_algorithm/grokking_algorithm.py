To recap, Dijkstra’s algorithm has four steps:
1. Find the cheapest node. This is the node you can get to in the least
amount of time.
2. Check whether there’s a cheaper path to the neighbors of this node.
If so, update their costs.
3. Repeat until you’ve done this for every node in the graph.
4. Calculate the final path. (Coming up in the next section!)
