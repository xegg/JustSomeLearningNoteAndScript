What are the best answers for "Why should I hire you"?
Ashish Kedia, Have cracked a lot of interviews Updated Jun 22, 2016
I know this is going to be a little arrogant, but here is what I did.

I was asked a question like this by a senior staff of a reputed company and I replied -

Because you're looking for the best and I am at least one of the best you've found till now. Otherwise we wouldn't be having this conversation. You know it. I know it. Let's just seal the deal. I am not after the money or your brand name. I am only after a challenging project and I know I will get it here. I won't work for you. I will work for myself.

I got the offer 2 days later.

I usually hate answering questions like this. I hate talking about myself. Ask me technical questions. However I do understand that these questions help interviewers to analyse what's going on inside a candidate's brain.

I did't try to be diplomatic. Many other candidates do this. Everyone says they are confident, hard working and interested in company's product. I wanted to be different. Even if it meant being over-confident. And I didn't want to prove my worth from company's point of view. I do internship for myself more than anyone less. And that's what I wanted to tell. Whatever thought came to mind I just told without decorating it with any diplomacy.
